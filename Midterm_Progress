The purpose of the R Toolkit for Student Retention is to provide a standardizd method of displaying student data using web-based visualization software to help with improving student retention.  Historically, the process of analyzing student-level data usually begins with a request.  Then, specific data for a specific timeframe is retrieved and used various software packages such as Excel and SPSS to provide the graphs, tables, and statistic measures.  Although each request may require using different student variables, common variables can be automated to help focus on those variables that effect student retention.  This project uses a shiny application dashboard to display consistent student data.  

The project infrastructure is in place and my role will be to formalize the data retrieval process with detailed instructions on what the data means, the different processes used that affect the data, and how data has changed historically.  My goal is to "teach" so they become proficient with setting up and using the toolkit and R in general by writing documentation and step-by-step instructions to get this R toolkit running on each users' computer.  While many of the seminars and presentations about student retention discuss analyzing specific variable, many attendees ask about the process of setting up the tools to even be able to analyze the variables.  I would like to provide answers to those that want to move past Excel.
