Mary and I met as a minimum once per week usually within the schedule class times.  Other coordinating and sharing of work done was done by email.

The folliowing is a description of my role in the project:

Created the midterm and final PowerPoint presentations because my task was to discuss student retention in general and put some context on the work that we were doing.  I thought it was better to also include the SQL side in the presentation since Mary was doing the demonstration part.

Brought the expertise when dealing with student retention (i.e., what variables would show something interesting)

Created the compreshensive SQL query that could work with changing data inside individual variables.  Mary helped with some of the trickier parts of SQL that I haven't used.

Revised the query as required to import data into R easier

Provided visualization examples of student retention and in one example, provided the R code.

Wrote the paper for the SIGCSE 2020 TS ACM Student Research Competition.  

Wrote the final paper with inputs from Mary for the Implementation and Experimental Result and Analysis sections along with Appendix 6 (Software Instructions for R) and Appendix 7 (R code used in the project).
